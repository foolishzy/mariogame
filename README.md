# mariogame
finally version
the marioGame demo

there are something wrong with the colide method between the mario and goombas,because the mario's body and goomba's body is circle shape ,and the goomba's head is a flip stair shape,sometimes when the mario is moving to goombas and then you control mario to jump to avoid coliding with goomba ,because as long as mario colide with goomba's body, mario will be killed. if the mario's speed is too fast, mario will colide with goomba's body and goomba's head at the same time, it means demo crashing. so i will improve it in the future, such as changing the colide method , limiting mario's speed, and adjust goomba's body and head relative position.
